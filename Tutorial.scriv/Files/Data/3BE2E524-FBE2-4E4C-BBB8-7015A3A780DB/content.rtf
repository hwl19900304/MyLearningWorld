\f0\fs28 \cf0 Some project templates use information from Contacts to populate title pages with your name and address. By default, it takes this information from \'93My Card\'94 in Contacts. If you would like Scrivener to use a different Contacts card, simply type \'93(Scrivener:UseMe)\'94 (with no spaces and including the parentheses) somewhere in the \'93note\'94 area of the entry in Contacts you wish to use.\
Even easier: Go to Scrivener > Preferences and enter your details in the \'93Author Information\'94 section of the \'93General\'94 pane.}
